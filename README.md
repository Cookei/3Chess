## Purpose and More
 This was created for fun to learn and see if I could make this version of chess. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to add checkmate (though check detection is in there), and implement a multiplayer feature.
 
 ## Chess Moves
  All chess moves are based on https://www.chessvariants.com/3d.dir/3d5.html
